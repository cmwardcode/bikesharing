# Analysis of Bike-Sharing Program in Des Moines
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to explore the data of the bike-sharing program in New York in hopes of developing a similar program in Des Moines. In order to get the program off the ground a proposal was developed for investors to determine if this is a viable program and determine costs.
## Results
A dashboard was developed using Tableau to display the visualizations for the investor proposal.

The first visualization was to determine the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. The largest number of bikes checked out was around 5 hours peaking at around 3000 bikes. The average number of time in use per hour was around half an hour.

Checkout times were then broken down by gender and the result was predominantly male users.

Trips by Weekday for Each Hour revealed that Thursday around 5pm and 6pm had the largest number of riders at around 44,000 to 45,000.

When the trips were then broken down further by gender. The results were males were the largest amount of users during thepeak Thursday 5/6 timeframe with around 31,000 users.

Users broken down into gender and usertype determined that male subscribers were the largest contributors at around 250,000.

August has the most conducive weather for biking conditions so it was used to determine the peak hours during that month. The highest demand was at 5 to 6pm peaking at around 225,000 bikes.

A Bike Repairs visualization was generated to help determine the amount of bikes that will need maintenance at higher frequency due to frequent usage. The higher usage was around 400 rides.

## Summary
When considering how viable a bike-share program would be in a different city it is important to look at data for a similar program which is why the client chose the NYC Citibikes. The second important piece is determining initial costs. The purpose of this analysis was to help determine supply and demand and costs of upkeep. The third factor to be considered is cost of return. The current data is unable to determine that outside of relating it to supply and demand. The final piece is comparing the NYC data to Des Moines in terms of population and weather differences and take those into account when deciding the viability of the program. 
Based on the visualizations created in the analysis the program seems to have a high demand and it seems to be consistent. On average a good suggested starting number of bikes would be around 100,000-200,000. Further data is needed on costs to determine is the program has enough return to be worth the costs upfront. 
Two additional visualizations for the future that would provide a better understanding to be able to make a decision would be comparison visualizations. Comparing NYC to Des Moines in terms of population, age, gender, and weather would allow for variations to be taken into account and applied to the NYC data. A second visualizations that would add benefit would be cost-analysis using the peak month of August to compare to bike repairs needed based on high usage.
